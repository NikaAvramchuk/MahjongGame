### About:


Our project is variation of a game called "Solitaire Mahjong". Your task in this game is to find a pair of matching tiles as fast
as you can and put them out of board by clicking on them. There is a total of 144 tiles. Our game is implementing all funcionalities
(you can read about them in this document), that are in most of "Mahjong Solitaire" variants, such as shuffling the board,
getting a clue, and restarting a game. But there is more. We wanted this game to be fun and we hope, that it will give it to you.

### Features:

1) Tiles Choose Menu: "You can choose a board on which you want to play on. For now there are 2 boards: black and standard. Black board
makes the tiles black, while standard makes it white.
2) Challange game mode: In challange mode, you will only have 30 seconds to find a pair and put it out of the board. If you won't, you will
lose 1 live. If you will lose 3 lives, the game will end and you can start another one. There is also a main timer, that indicates, how
time has passed from the start of the game. In the future, the points algorithm based on that timer will also be implemented.
3) Normal game mode: It's like the "challange mode", but you have infinite time to find a pair of tiles and you will not lose any of
your lives.
4) Shuffle, clue and restart: Shuffle button presented on top of the game screen will shuffle the tiles on the board for you, if you
press it. Clue button will highlight a pair of mathing tiles for you. But it will also add to your main timer 30 seconds.
Restart will restart your curreng game, building up new board, resetting your lives to 3, if you lost any and also resets your timer
move.
5) Music: For now there are a total of 4 songs, played randomly, but you can choose to silent the music.
6) Scores table: If you manage to finish the game with time that is better than last time from "top 5 times", the game will
update scores table and you will be able to see your name and your time in the proper position in top 5 scores table
